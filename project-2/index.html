    <h3>Step 1: Notation </h3></br>
    There are 6 sides that make up the cube. Each of these sides are named in two ways: how you hold the cube, and the color of side.</br>
  </br>
    While holding the cube (no matter the color), the face that is facing you is considered the "Front" The face that is facing away from your body is the "Back",
    with the Left, Right, Up, and Down respectivly. These faces are summarized by the letters F,B,L,R,U,D these letters are used to write algorithms. These algorithms
     are used to define how to move the puzzle. A normal letter (R) means to turn that side clockwise (as if you were looking at that face directly). A letter with
     an apostrophy (R') is "inverted", meaning to turn that side counter-clockwise (as if you were looking at that face directly). Through these notations, we can string
     together many moves to create algorithms. </br>
      Example: R' D' R D </br>
     The other way to define a side is by defining it's color. Within a standard 3x3x3 cube, the middle piece will never move. Therefore the middle color defines the side color.

  <h2> Step 2: Solve the Cross </h2>

  The first step to actually solve it, is to chose a side. For this example, it will be red. I recomend that you chose a side, and always solve for it while you learn.
  Once you have chosen a color, you must solve for the side pieces and connect them to the adjacent sides. This should form a "cross" or an "X". It is VERY important that
  the side pieces connect with the other center colors as well. </br>
  Unfortunately, there are no algorithms for this step. You must solve for the cross using logic and reasoning alone. However, here are a few tips: </br>
  1) Align an edge piece with an adjacent color, then rotate that side to align the colors up to the cross.
  2) If an edge piece is already on the face you are attempting to solve for, rotate it down to the bottom layer, then reintroduce it properly oriented.
  3) Once you have a cross formed, double-check all sides for allignment with the adjacent centers.
