*Repository for Intro to Web Design.*

I am surrounded by web design. Not only by the daily interactions with websites, but my mother creates and designs websites as a career. So these skills are familiar to me, but I wanted to know more and to understand what kind of work she does. As well as create similarly impressive web-pages.

The internet is:  
- An Interconnected web of other networks
- Independently operated systems interconnecting almost every device

**404 Poem**
*parody of Edgar Allan Poe*

Once upon a midnight dreary, While I studied, weak and weary, Over many a strange and curious website of how-to's and forums mixed.

While I clicked my homework, Suddenly there came a warning, And my heart was filled with mourning, Mourning for my dear grades, never fixed.

'Tis not possible!', I pleaded, But my browser, so conceited, Remained blank, I then repeated, Just a blank and nothing more.

With a scream, I was defeated, For my grades were depleted. As I searched the FAQs, and the unknown regions. In search I was for, the secret to my score.

Then, in answer to my query, Through the net I loved so dearly, Came its answer, dark and dreary: Quoth the server, 404





- The Website still seems a bit broken.
