    <h3>Step 1: Notation </h3></br>
    There are 6 sides that make up the cube. Each of these sides are named in two ways: how you hold the cube, and the color of side.</br>
  </br>
    While holding the cube (no matter the color), the face that is facing you is considered the "Front" The face that is facing away from your body is the "Back",
    with the Left, Right, Up, and Down respectivly. These faces are summarized by the letters F,B,L,R,U,D these letters are used to write algorithms. These algorithms
     are used to define how to move the puzzle. A normal letter (R) means to turn that side clockwise (as if you were looking at that face directly). A letter with
     an apostrophy (R') is "inverted", meaning to turn that side counter-clockwise (as if you were looking at that face directly). Through these notations, we can string
     together many moves to create algorithms. </br>
      Example: R' D' R D </br>
     The other way to define a side is by defining it's color. Within a standard 3x3x3 cube, the middle piece will never move. Therefore the middle color defines the side color.
