    <li><u><b>Briefly describe yourself.</b></u></li>
    <p>
      I am currently a senior at University of Montana, in the Media Arts department. My big project that I am working on at the moment is a virtual reality video game.
      I'm hoping to have this game completed by the time I graduate. My interests include: Science, Games, Movies, History & Mythology.
      My goal for my career is if I can create something that changes someone's life. If I make a movie, or a game that helps make someone's life better, then my career will be a success.
    </p>

    <li><u><b>Why did you choose this project for your Instructable?</b></u></li>
    <p>
      Throughout my life so far, I have tried to learn as much as I could as long as I found it interesting. Though these endeavors, I have obtained some frankly odd skills. One of which is how to solve a Rubik's Cube.
      I have a skill that many of my friends have asked me to teach them. Having a link to send them as a guide would be really helpful. When I saw this assignment, I knew rubik's cubes were the right choice.
      Recently, I have gotten back into this hobby by learning a new and faster method for solving it.
